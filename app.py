A simple message broker.

There are three HTTP APIs, mapping to three in-memory data structures: asyncio.Queue, list, and
collections.deque. The leading component of the HTTP URLs indicates which data structure backs it.

You can post any HTTP body to these URLs to publish a message, filling in the topic of your choice:

    /queue/<topic>
    /list/<topic>
    /deque/<topic>

Clients may GET at similar URLs, but clients must add an additional queue name to the URL to denote
which queue they wish to read from:

    /queue/<topic>/<queue>
    /list/<topic>/<queue>
    /deque/<topic>/<queue>

Queues are created when the first GET request is made to a particular topic and queue name.

GET requests on the /list/ and /deque/ APIs are able to request an offset by including a GET query
parameter called offset that indexes an integer value of the requested offset.

There is a websocket listening at /ws. Connected clients can subscribe to exactly one topic by
sending a string naming the topic they wish to subscribe to, and then messages on that topic will be
sent to the client as they arrive on the server.

Finally, there is a /make_it_slow_number_one/<topic>/<queue> API that you can POST an integer to.
The posted value indicates how many random messages to generate into the given topic and queue for
all three data structures, and is useful to get messages into the queues more quickly than can be
done using the APIs directly for load testing purposes.

For all APIs, topics are created once any reader or writer references them. Queues are created once
GET requests are made referencing them. Topics and queues are never destroyed.

asyncio.Queue is the most obvious data structure to use when building a message broker. It performs
well, and obviously it's already ready for asynchronous use. However, the Queue does not support
indexing into the data, which means this implementation does not support the offset feature. Thus,
the advantages are simplicity and performance, with the disadvantage of missing the offset feature.

The list is the most obvious data structure to use when needing to access elements at arbitrary
offsets. The list starts to degrade in performance once it reaches large numbers of messages (a few
hundred thousand) since it stores data linearly in memory, causing pop and push operations to be
inefficient. The advantage of the list is that is has a natural API for the offset feature, but the
performance is a significant disadvantage, and it needs to be wrapped for asynchronous use.

The API implementation with the deque is slightly more involved than the list, but it performs
similarly to the Queue, and supports clients that request an offset. The advantage to this
data structure is that it performs well and is able to deliver the offset feature. The disadvantages
are that it brings a little extra complexity with the rotate calls and it needs to be wrapped for
asynchronous use.
